            <p>Some of my friends are lazy and want to create websites more often. So I thought, why not create a website 
                while learning and use this as a place for others to learn too?</p>

            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Liam Alkobi, a passionate Chemistry and Computer Science student at UNSW. 
                My journey in the world of science is driven by a deep-seated belief that the solutions to complex questions 
                lie at the intersection of these fields. When I'm not immersed in my studies or work, you can find me skating through the streets of Sydney. 
                I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share a love for science, adventure, and personal growth. Feel free to reach out!</p>

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>I started my journey in science and computer science at UNSW, driven by curiosity and a passion for learning. 
                From managing operations at Breadfern Bakery to tutoring high school students and engaging in research projects, I've gained experience across various fields. 
                I am currently seeking opportunities in Sydney, where I reside, including roles as a Private Tutor, Summer Intern, Research Assistant, and Computer Programmer.</p>
